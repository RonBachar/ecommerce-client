  <h1>Welcome, I'm Ron!</h1>
  <br /><br />
  <p>
      Hi there! My name is Ron and I'm excited to share with you some of the key features and technologies I've implemented in my Angular application. Let's dive in!
  </p>
  <br />
  <ul>
      <li>
          <strong>Angular Architecture:</strong> My application is built using Angular, leveraging its architecture principles including components, directives, and services for a structured and modular design.
      </li>
      <li>
          <strong>Angular Features:</strong> I've utilized various Angular features such as standalone components, modules, routing, pipes, and services to build a robust and maintainable application.
      </li>
      <li>
          <strong>Node.js Backend with Express:</strong> For the backend, I've implemented RESTful APIs, authentication, and more using Node.js and Express, ensuring seamless communication between the frontend and backend layers of the application.
      </li>
      <li>
          <strong>Mock Database Integration:</strong> To simulate data management, I've integrated a mock database, allowing me to test and develop the application's data-related functionalities without relying on a real database.
      </li>
      <li>
          <strong>Responsive Design and UI/UX:</strong> User experience is paramount, which is why I've focused on creating a responsive user interface using Angular Material and other UI libraries. This ensures that the application looks and works great across various devices and screen sizes.
      </li>
  </ul>
